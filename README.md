# Hugo Boilerplate

My own personal boilerplate for building simple static websites using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

To run this boilerplate you will need a content directory and initialize with `npm install`.

For development you should run `gulp` in one console and `hugo server -w -v` in another
